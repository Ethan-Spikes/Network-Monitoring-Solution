# "secure1host"

The goal is to make a single script that secures your device quickly and easily. It only works on Debian-base Linux distros.

My intention is to use this project to learn as much as I can about defending a computer.

Most of the work I have done so far has been learning the basics of writing a script and how to properly structure a script so that it doesn't become unmanageable.
