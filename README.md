# "secure a single host" walkthrough

The plan is to make this tool useable to a wide variety of users, and allow users to set and define multiple security configurations simply and easily.

I plan on completing Auto_Mode sometime soon.

I plan on fleshing out the functions as I learn and grow in cybersecurity.

the next step is to learn how to include variables in a file into the script

then I need to make the configuration mode

then I need to figure out how it will deploy and make the installer? We'll see.

the plan is to create a series of scripts that walk me through the steps of securing a single host.

This will take inspiration from MITRE Defend and the BTFM

So far, this will only run on Debian Linux Distrobutions.
